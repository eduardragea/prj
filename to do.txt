- add read me to code to indicate how to run it
- change hybrid form partition to median quicksort and rerun both cases 0of datasets
- do study for first element as pivot and for random element as pivot and then partition
- limitations 	- recursive calls need to set it from sys
		- Stack algorithm can only use top of the stack as pivot so for ascending it won't work
- write in intro or sth the goal of this project is to determine how different sorting algorithms behave
based on the given dataset and at what point they reach their top efficiency paired with when they are
running at worst case scenario. For this study, the algorithms in use are quicksort, merge sort,
insertion sort and variations between them.
